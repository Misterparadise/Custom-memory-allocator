Custom Heap Memory Allocator 

*Implemented a custom heap memory allocator from scratch, replacing malloc / free.

*Designed and implemented free-list–based memory management with block metadata headers.

*Implemented allocation, deallocation, block splitting, and coalescing to reduce fragmentation.

*Used pointer arithmetic and low-level memory manipulation while ensuring alignment and correctness.

*Debugged memory corruption issues using assertions and targeted test cases.
